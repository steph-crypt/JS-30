    // Let's say we have an array
    const ojCase = ['robert', 'juice', 'marcia', 'nicole']

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    const ojCase2 = ojCase

    //changes original array

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'Lux';
    ojCase[2] = 'boyfriend'

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    //1)

    // one way
    //2)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    //3)

    //4


    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    //changes only the copy. Does not reference the original aray.

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object


    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;


    // how do we take a copy instead?



    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};


    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
