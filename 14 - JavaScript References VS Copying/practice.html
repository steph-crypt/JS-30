    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    //1)
    let babies3 = babies.slice();
    // one way
    //2)
    const babies5 = [].concat(babies);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    //3)
    let babies5 = [...babies];
    //4)
    const babies6 = Array.from(babies);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    babies6[2] = "Bill Clinton"
    //changes only the copy. Does not reference the original aray.

    const sofia = {
      age: 31,
      sign: 'Gemini'
    };

    // with Objects
  const lilSophia = sofia;
    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captain = person;
    // captain.number = 99;
    lilSophia.age = 14;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const sophia = Object.assign({}, sofia {age: 14, sign: 'cancer'});

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};
const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
